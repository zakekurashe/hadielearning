          <p>

            Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we ask our users and their authorized agents to do the same. It is our policy to expeditiously
            respond to clear notifications of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) of 1998, the text of which

          <h2>What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</h2>
          <p>
            Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with
            us.

          <h2>Notifications of infringement</h2>
          <p>
            If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any material available on our Services infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a written
            copyright infringement notification (“Notification”) using the contact details below pursuant to the DMCA. All such Notifications must comply with the DMCA
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has
            satisfied these requirements, our response may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact
            the affected user with information concerning the removal or restriction of access.
          </p>

            Not with standing anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Operator reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright
            infringement notification if it fails to comply with all the requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.
